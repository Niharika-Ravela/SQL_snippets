# Sample Datasets

Mock datasets used to illustrate SQL examples in this repository.

- **payroll.csv** — payroll registers showing hours, pay periods, and pay amounts  
- **timesheets.csv** — employee-reported hours for reconciliation examples  
- **employees.csv** — employee master data  
- **departments.csv** — department lookup table for analytics  
- **invoices.csv** — vendor invoice amounts for anomaly detection  

These datasets are intentionally small for clarity and reproducibility.
